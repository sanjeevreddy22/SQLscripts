Buffer cache hit ratio it should be Higher value(above 90%)

SELECT (a.cntr_value * 1.0 / b.cntr_value) * 100.0 as BufferCacheHitRatio
FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters  a
JOIN  (SELECT cntr_value,OBJECT_NAME 
    FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters

AND a.OBJECT_NAME = 'SQLServer:Buffer Manager'

=============================
page life Expensive pwe it should be more then 300 or 4028 for 64bit 

SELECT *
FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters  
WHERE counter_name = 'Page life expectancy'
AND OBJECT_NAME = 'SQLServer:Buffer Manager'
