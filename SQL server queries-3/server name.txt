Running the following will show the current TSQL value for this property:

SELECT @@SERVERNAME;
GO

To Fix the Problem

If the @@ServerName property is NULL, running the following will fix the issue- but only after you restart the SQL Server instance. Yep, fixing this requires an outage.

EXEC sp_addserver '<LocalServerName>', local;
GO

If the @@ServerName property is incorrect, run the following to correct the issue:

EXEC sp_dropserver 'old_name';
GO
EXEC sp_addserver 'new_name', 'local';
GO
