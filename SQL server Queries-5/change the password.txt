Ademir Passos

Few days ago, a client asked me to help them change the password for all SQL Server login accounts on a given instance.
A strong random password should be generate for each of them, of course.
Pinal Dave gave the script to generate the random password - where you can choose the length of your password as well - Thanks!
So I used it in a loop where I could:
- Automatically generate a new password for each SQL Server Login existing in the instance
- Automatically generate T-SQL command to alter password
- Include Server Name ( why not? ). 
This way you can use the output to control or store what you've done - which logins you've alter the password and on which server. Surely you'll need it some time in the future!
Enjoy it!
